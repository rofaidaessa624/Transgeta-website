              <p>Trans-Gate is committed to providing translation and educational support services in line with high professional and ethical standards. Our mission is to deliver accurate, clear, and helpful guidance while promoting honest learning and academic integrity. We offer translation, tutoring, editing, reviewing, and consultation services for students, researchers, and professionals who seek to expand their knowledge, improve academic writing, and develop research skills. We do not complete assignments, write research papers, theses, dissertations, or any academic work on behalf of clients, nor do we create or alter content in ways that mislead or violate ethical standards.</p>
              <p>By using our services, you accept full responsibility for your academic or professional work. Our role is to guide and support, not to replace your effort. Any assistance provided, including research support, translation, feedback, or editing, is intended solely for learning, improvement, or communication purposes. Misusing our services is strictly prohibited. Submitting translations, advice, suggestions, or reviewed materials as original work without proper acknowledgment violates both academic integrity and professional ethics, and Trans-Gate does not condone such actions.</p>
              <p>Clients are responsible for ensuring that any materials or guidance they receive comply with relevant laws, regulations, and the academic or ethical policies of their institutions. Trans-Gate is not liable for how its services are used, and clients bear full responsibility for the final use of any materials, notes, or consultations provided. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone attempting to misuse our platform for academic dishonesty, information manipulation, or other unethical purposes.</p>
              
              <h4 className="fs-5 border-start border-2 border-info ps-3 ms-4 my-4">By continuing to use our services, clients agree to comply with this ethics policy and to support responsible, ethical learning and professional practices.</h4>
